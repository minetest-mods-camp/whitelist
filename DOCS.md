# Whitelist Docs

## 1. How it works

Whitelisted players and whitelist status are both saved into the mod storage, and they're updated every time one of the core functions below succeeds. The end (?)

## 2. Functions
### 2.1 Core

> The `sender` field in here is optional. If specified, the sender will receive an output message

* `whitelist.enable(<sender>)`: enables the whitelist
* `whitelist.disable(<sender>)`: disables the whitelist
* `whitelist.add_player(p_name, <sender>)`: adds `p_name` to the whitelist
* `whitelist.remove_player(p_name, <sender>)`: removes `p_name` from the whitelist

### 2.2 Utils
* `whitelist.print_list(sender)`: prints a message to `sender` containing all the whitelisted players
* `whitelist.is_player_whitelisted(p_name)`: returns whether `p_name` is whitelisted, as a boolean
* `whitelist.is_whitelist_enabled()`: returns whether the whitelist is enabled, as a boolean
